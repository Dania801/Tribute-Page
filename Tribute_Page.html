                  <li><b>1906 - </b> Born in New York City .</li>
                  <li><b>1913 - </b>She decided to determine how an alarm clock worked .</li>
                  <li><b>1928 - </b>She graduated from Vassar with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics .</li>
                  <li><b>1930 - </b>She earned her master's degree at Yale University .</li>
                  <li><b>1931 - </b>She began teaching mathematics at Vassar .</li>
                  <li><b>1934 - </b>She earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale .</li>
                  <li><b>Mark I Computer - </b>She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken coauthored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator .</li>
                  <li><b>UNIVAC - </b>In 1949, She joined the team developing the UNIVAC I . When she recommended that a new programming language be developed using entirely English words, she "was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English." </li>
                  <li><b>1952 - </b>She had an operational compiler. "Nobody believed that," she said. "I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic" .</li>
                  <li><b>COBOL - </b>In 1959 COBOL was defined . This new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy .</li>
                  <li><b>1970s - </b>She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL.</li>
                  <li><b>1964 - </b>Hopper was awarded the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, the Societyâ€™s highest honor, "In recognition of her significant contributions to the burgeoning computer industry as an engineering manager and originator of automatic programming systems" .</li>
                  <li><b>1966 - </b>Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander . </li>
                  <li><b>1992 - </b>Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes on New Year's Day .</li>
