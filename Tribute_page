Grace Hopper 

- 1906 - Born in New York City .
- 1913 - She decided to determine how an alarm clock worked . 
- 1928 - She graduated from Vassar with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics . 
- 1930 - She earned her master's degree at Yale University . 
- 1931 - She began teaching mathematics at Vassar .
- 1934 - She earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale .
- Mark I Computer - She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken coauthored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.
-UNIVAC - In 1949, She joined the team developing the UNIVAC I . When she recommended that a new programming language be developed using entirely English words, she "was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English." 
- 1952 - She had an operational compiler. "Nobody believed that," she said. "I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic."
- COBOL - In 1959 COBOL was defined . This new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy .
- 1970s - She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL.
-1964 - Hopper was awarded the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, the Societyâ€™s highest honor, "In recognition of her significant contributions to the burgeoning computer industry as an engineering manager and originator of automatic programming systems"
-1966 - Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander . 
-1992 - Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes on New Year's Day .
